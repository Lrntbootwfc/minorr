PricePilot: Dynamic Pricing Optimization Web Application
 Project Overview
PricePilot is a dynamic pricing web application designed to optimize product pricing in real-time using machine learning (ML). This platform leverages sophisticated algorithms like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Bayesian Optimization to predict demand fluctuations and adjust prices accordingly.

It helps businesses maximize revenue while ensuring competitiveness in the market by offering automated, data-driven pricing strategies.

 Key Features
Real-Time Pricing Adjustments: Dynamically adjusts prices based on demand, inventory, and market conditions.

Behavioral Analytics: Utilizes consumer behavior data (buying and return trends) to refine pricing strategies.

Predictive Modeling: Uses historical data to forecast demand, ensuring that prices are always aligned with predicted market movements.

API Integration: Supports real-time data syncing and price updates with integrated APIs.

User Authentication: Secure login system, using Google authentication to manage user profiles and personalized data.

üìù How It Works
Data Collection: The system collects data on product sales, historical prices, market conditions, and consumer behavior.

Price Prediction: Using machine learning models (GBM and Bayesian Optimization), the platform predicts optimal prices for products based on the collected data.

Dynamic Pricing: Prices are updated in real-time on the website/application, reflecting changes in demand, inventory, and market conditions.

User Interaction: Admins can upload product data, view price simulations, and track pricing performance via an intuitive dashboard.


üåê Usage
Login: Access the platform via the login page. Use Google login for easy authentication.

Dashboard: Once logged in, view the dashboard displaying product details, dynamic pricing stats, and real-time updates.

Price Adjustment: Upload products and set pricing conditions for real-time pricing updates.
